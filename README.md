This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in VBScript's error handling. The `bug.vbs` file shows a function that uses `Err.Raise` without proper error handling.  This can lead to the application unexpectedly terminating if the parameter passed to the function is empty.  The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version that implements robust error handling, ensuring a more graceful failure and better user experience.
